Webapp XUL Wrapper for the SaltOS project
-----------------------------
This project is a fork of the original project with some modifications to execute SaltOS as a desktop application.

Changes made by me:
- Modified the original files to be used in the SaltOS project
- Added the PHP binaries files and some startup scripts
